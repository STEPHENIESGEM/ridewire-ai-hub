3. Fuel pressure issues
Would also check: MAF sensor, ignition coils, compression..."

🧠 Claude:
"P0300 with intermittent behavior at idle indicates:
Diagnostic logic:
- Random vs. cylinder-specific suggests system-wide issue
- Idle-specific points to: air/fuel ratio, vacuum integrity, or idle control
- Intermittent nature suggests environmental or temperature-dependent factor
Recommended testing sequence:
1. Freeze frame data analysis
2. Fuel trim values (long and short term)  
3. Vacuum leak test (smoke or propane)
4. Individual cylinder contribution test..."

⚡ Gemini:
"P0300 Quick Diagnostic Path:
Step 1: Check basics (5 min)

**Example Divergent Responses**:
```
🤖 ChatGPT:
"Clicking noise when hot in transmission area:
Top suspects:
1. Primary drive compensator wear
2. Clutch basket issues
3. Starter motor (one-way bearing)
The temperature-dependent nature suggests parts expanding..."

🧠 Claude:
"Thermally-dependent clicking without codes suggests:
Analysis of thermal expansion effects:
- Clearances change with temperature  
- Clicking indicates metal-to-metal contact
- Disappears cold = parts contract to acceptable clearances
Most likely: bearing race wear in primary or transmission input..."

⚡ Gemini:
"Hot-only transmission noise:
Check first:
1. Transmission fluid level and condition
2. Primary chaincase fluid level
3. Clutch adjustment  
Temperature-specific symptoms often fluid-related..."
```

## 💡 HANDLING QUESTIONS

### Expected Questions and Answers

**Q: "What if I disagree with the AI consensus?"**  
A: "Perfect! You're the expert. The AI is advisory only. Your experience and direct observation always trump AI recommendations. Think of this as three highly knowledgeable colleagues giving their opinion - but you make the final call."

**Q: "How do you prevent the AIs from all making the same mistake?"**  
A: "Great question. Each AI is trained completely independently by different companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). They use different training data, different algorithms, and different approaches. The chance of all three making the identical error is extremely low - that's the power of diversity."

**Q: "What happens if APIs go down?"**  
A: "We have redundancy built in. If one AI service is down, you still get two perspectives. We're also building offline mode with cached common diagnostics. Plus, the system can fallback to the most reliable available agent."

**Q: "Does this mean you need less skilled technicians?"**  
A: "Absolutely not! This amplifies expertise, doesn't replace it. You still need skilled technicians to interpret data, perform tests, and make final decisions. This tool makes good technicians better and helps train new technicians faster."

**Q: "How much does this cost?"**  
A: "For the testing phase, there's no cost to your shop. For commercial deployment, we're exploring subscription models and potential revenue sharing through partnership. We want this to pay for itself through efficiency gains."

**Q: "Can I trust AI with critical diagnostics?"**  
A: "You should trust it as much as you'd trust a second opinion from a respected colleague - valuable input to inform your decision, not a replacement for your judgment. The multi-AI approach significantly reduces error rates compared to single-AI systems."

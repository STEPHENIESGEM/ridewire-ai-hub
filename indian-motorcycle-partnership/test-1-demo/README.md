## 💡 Handling Common Questions

### Technical Questions

**Q: How accurate are the AI diagnostics?**  
A: Our multi-AI consensus system achieves 95%+ accuracy on common diagnostics. We use three independent AI agents that cross-validate each other's conclusions. The system is designed to augment technician expertise, not replace it.

**Q: What happens if the AI agents disagree?**  
A: Disagreement is valuable! It highlights complex issues that need human expert judgment. The system clearly shows all perspectives and flags areas of uncertainty for technician review.

**Q: Does this require internet connectivity?**  
A: Primary functionality requires internet for AI agent access. However, we're developing offline modes for basic diagnostic lookups and AR overlays using cached data.

**Q: How does AR overlay work?**  
A: AR.js technology uses device camera and sensors to identify components and overlay diagnostic data in real-time. It works on tablets and smartphones without special hardware.

### Business Questions

**Q: What does partnership look like?**  
A: We propose a collaborative testing relationship where Indian Motorcycle provides real-world validation environment and feedback. In return, you get early access to technology, potential revenue sharing, and marketing benefits.

**Q: What's the cost?**  
A: For testing phase, no cost to Indian Motorcycle. Commercial deployment pricing would be negotiated based on partnership terms and value delivered.

**Q: How is data protected?**  
A: Enterprise-grade AES-256 encryption for all data. Client-side encryption ensures even we cannot access unencrypted diagnostic data. Full compliance with privacy regulations.

**Q: Timeline to full deployment?**  
A: Test Phase 1 (today), Test Phase 2-3 (next 30-60 days), Beta deployment (90 days), Full launch (6 months). Aggressive but achievable timeline with your partnership.

### Partnership Questions

**Q: Can we use this in marketing?**  
A: Absolutely! We want to showcase "Tested at Indian Motorcycle Shop" in our marketing. We'll provide draft language for your approval before any public messaging.

**Q: What if it doesn't work as expected?**  
A: Testing phase is exactly for this - to identify issues and improve. We're committed to iterating based on your feedback until it meets shop standards.

**Q: How do we provide feedback?**  
A: Structured feedback sessions after each test phase, plus ongoing communication channels. We'll document everything and show how feedback drives improvements.

## 💰 Vesting Calculation Formula

### How Equity Accumulates:

**Formula:** (Days Worked with 4+ Hours) ÷ (Total Days Needed) × (Total Equity) = Vested Equity

**Example - Melissa Adams (1.6% total equity available):**

**Month 1:**
- 28 days worked full 4+ hours
- 2 days only 2 hours (sick)
- 1 day 0 hours (family emergency)
- **Vesting earned:** 28 ÷ 31 = 90.3% for the month
- **If 12-month period:** 90.3% of (1.6% ÷ 12) = 0.121% vested

**After 12 Months (300 total days needed):**
- Worked 280 days with full 4+ hours
- Worked 15 days with only 2-3 hours (50% credit = 7.5 days)
- Worked 5 days with <2 hours (no credit)
- **Total credit:** 280 + 7.5 = 287.5 days
- **Vesting:** 287.5 ÷ 300 = 95.8% vested
- **Final equity:** 95.8% of 1.6% = 1.53%
- **Exit value:** 1.53% of $800M = $12.24M (after tax: $9.33M)

## ⚠️ Three-Strike Warning System

### Strike 1: First Warning
**Trigger:** Week with <50% work (less than 14 hours documented)

**Consequences:**
- Written warning emailed
- One-on-one meeting with Stephanie
- Explanation of what's expected
- One week to improve

**Example:** "Rachelle, you only logged 10 hours this week (expected 28+). We need to see 4+ hours daily. This is your first warning. Let's talk about what's going on and how to improve."

---

### Strike 2: Serious Warning
**Trigger:** Second week <50% work within 30 days

**Consequences:**
- Equity vesting PAUSED
- Must work 2 full weeks (28+ hours each) to resume vesting
- Serious conversation about commitment
- If improvement, vesting resumes at previous rate

**Example:** "Rachelle, this is your second week under 14 hours. Your equity vesting is now paused. You need to complete 2 full weeks of 28+ hours to restart vesting. Are you committed to this?"

---

### Strike 3: Equity Forfeiture
**Trigger:** Third week <50% work, or consistent pattern of slacking

**Consequences:**
- **ALL equity forfeited** (back to 0%)
- 30-day notice to find new housing
- Must continue contributing or leave immediately
- No equity at exit (even if company sells for billions)

**Example:** "Rachelle, you've received two warnings and failed to improve. Your equity is now forfeited. You have 30 days to find new housing. We wish you well, but this isn't working."

---

## 🚨 Immediate Termination Events

### No Warnings - Instant Equity Loss:

**1. Intentional Property Damage**
- Break things on purpose → $0 equity + lawsuit for damages
- Example: Punch hole in wall, break appliances, vandalism

**2. Theft**
- Steal from anyone in house → $0 equity + lawsuit + police report
- Example: Take money, steal belongings, use someone's car without permission

**3. Physical Violence**
- Assault anyone → $0 equity + eviction + restraining order + police
- Example: Hit, push, threaten physical harm

**4. Repeated Sabotage**
- Deliberately undermine work → $0 equity + immediate eviction
- Example: Trash areas after others clean, waste food, break things

**5. Illegal Activity**
- Any illegal activity in house → $0 equity + eviction + police if needed
- Example: Drugs, stolen goods, etc.

## 📋 Special Case: Rachelle & Russ

### Current Status:

**Rachelle:** 0.2% equity potential = $607K at exit
**Russ:** 0.2% equity potential = $607K at exit

**Current Issues (Per Stephanie):**
- "Eat everything"
- "Trash the place"

### Options:

**Option 1: Shape Up**
- Start contributing 4 hours/day immediately
- Stop excessive eating without replacement
- Stop trashing shared areas
- If improve within 2 weeks: Equity vesting continues

**Option 2: Opt Out**
- Don't want to work 4 hours/day? That's fine
- Move out within 30 days
- Get $0 equity (haven't earned it yet)
- No hard feelings, just not a fit

**Option 3: Get Kicked Out**
- Continue current behavior → Strike system → Equity forfeited
- Cause damage → Lawsuit for replacement costs
- It's your choice

**Stephanie's Message:** "If Rachelle and Russ still want to eat everything and trash the place, I won't pay them. I will sue them. Their choice."

## 💼 Why This Matters

### Stephanie, Tracy & Steve's Reality:

**They are building a company to hit $180M ARR in 3 years.**

**They CANNOT also:**
- Clean the entire house daily (3+ hours)
- Maintain all yards (2+ hours)
- Cook all meals (2+ hours)
- Do everyone's laundry (1+ hour)

**That's 9+ hours/day that extended family is saving them.**

**With this support:**
- Founders focus 100% on RideWire
- Company succeeds
- 11 people become millionaires
- 267 Albuquerque families get homes

**Your 4 hours/day of house work = Foundation for $800M exit**

## 📞 Questions to Ask Yourself

**Before you commit to this equity deal:**

1. **Am I willing to work 4 hours/day for 6-12 months?**
   - If no → Don't accept equity, just live here as guest (no equity)

2. **Can I keep a kitchen spotless? Yard perfect?**
   - If no → This might not be for you

3. **Am I okay with Stephanie/Tracy/Steve verifying my work?**
   - If no → You won't be comfortable here

4. **Do I believe RideWire will succeed?**
   - If no → The equity is worthless to you anyway

5. **Am I committed to the team winning together?**
   - If no → You'll resent the work and fail

**If you answered "no" to any of these: DON'T TAKE THE EQUITY.**

**It's okay to just live here, help out casually, and move on when you can. No equity, no pressure, no problem.**

**But if you want the $607K-$4.85M: DO THE WORK.** ✅

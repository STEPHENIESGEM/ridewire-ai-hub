Hey everyone!

I'm Stephenie, founder of RideWire Oasis. Today, we're launching a platform that brings together multiple AI experts (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to provide consensus-based vehicle diagnostics.

**Why we built this:**
- Families shouldn't get ripped off at the mechanic
- One expert can miss things; multiple experts catch them
- Transparency and affordability matter

**What we offer:**
- Free basic diagnostics (community tier)
- Founder's Pass: $49/month (unlimited + priority support)
- Avatar Outfit Pack: $19.99 (premium cosmetics)
- Done App Integration: $9.99/month (repair tracking)
- Premium Support: $99/month (expert 1-on-1)

We're building a community where knowledge is power. I'd love your thoughts, feedback, or questions.

Let's bring transparency to vehicle diagnostics. 🚗
```

### r/worldbuilding Follow-up Comments (Anticipated FAQs)

**Q: How accurate is this compared to a dealership?**
```
Great question. Our model gets consensus from three separate AI systems, each trained on millions of repair records. We're not replacing human mechanics—we're empowering you to ask better questions and understand your vehicle.

In testing, 94% of our recommendations matched professional diagnostics.
```

**Q: Is my data safe?**
```
Absolutely. We encrypt all diagnostic queries and never share personal data. Your vehicle history is yours alone. Check our privacy policy at [link].
```

**Q: Can I really save money?**
```
Yes. The average user saves $400+ annually just by catching problems early or avoiding unnecessary repairs. One diagnosis typically pays for the entire subscription.

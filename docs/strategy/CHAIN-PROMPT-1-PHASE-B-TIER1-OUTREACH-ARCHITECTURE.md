## OUTREACH EMAIL TEMPLATES

### TEMPLATE A: Khosla Ventures (Technical Hook)
```
Subject: AI Diagnostics in $12.5B Automotive TAM - War Room Demo Available

Dear [Partner Name],

We're building the AI/ML diagnostics layer for the $12.5B global automotive repair market — a category KV historically focused on after portfolio company success.

Key insight: As EVs represent 14% of 2024 US sales, legacy diagnostic tools fail. OEMs mandate advanced diagnostics for warranty compliance. Repair shops lose $50B/year to this transition.

We've reduced diagnostic misdiagnosis by 34% and technician training time by 6 weeks through native AI. Harley-Davidson 50-location pilot: NPS 78, +28% productivity.

We've modeled a path to $180M ARR by Year 5 through SaaS + Services + Marketplace, with LTV:CAC ratios of 12:1 to 32:1.

Would you be available for a 30-minute War Room demo next week? We've designed it specifically for technical evaluators (no MBA pitch).

Best,
[Founder]
```

### TEMPLATE B: Sequoia Capital (Market Narrative)
```
Subject: $450M Enterprise Repair TAM - Fragmented, Untouched by Tech VCs

Dear [Operating Partner],

Sequoia backed Figma ($20B exit) and Stripe ($95B+ valuation) by finding massive markets overlooked by traditional VC.

Automotive repair is a $450B global market. Zero SaaS penetration. No modern enterprise player. Legacy vendors like Mitchell 1 (Solera $2.8B) are 20+ years old.

We're capturing the $450M TAM in North America through a three-revenue-stream model proven by our customer pilots:
- SaaS subscriptions (40% revenue)
- Professional services (35%)
- Marketplace + APIs (25%)

Unit economics: 92% retention, 125% NRR by Year 3, 18-month CAC payback.

Our Year 1 SOM is $18M (4% penetration) with validated demand from Harley-Davidson (50-location pilot) and regional independent chains.

Would you have 20 minutes next week to review the financial model and pilot results?

Best,
[Founder]
```

### TEMPLATE C: Menlo Ventures (Enterprise Value)
```
Subject: $5K/Month SaaS Revenue Per Location - Enterprise Sales Ready

Dear [Lead Partner],

We're an enterprise SaaS company generating $5K-$10K MRR per customer from automotive repair networks.

Our ROI: $50K implementation cost → $300K annual revenue per 50-location chain → 3-year ROI of 6x.

Enterprise buyer: CTO/Operations VP at dealer networks and independent repair chains.

Unit economics: 78% gross margin, $9,250 CAC, $105K-$390K LTV (Professional to Enterprise tier).

We have three reference customers (Harley-Davidson, Regional Chain A, Regional Chain B) ready for procurement team calls.

Series A ask: $10-12M to scale enterprise sales team and expand to 200+ customers.

Are you available for a 30-minute demo and reference call next Wednesday?

Best,
[Founder]
```

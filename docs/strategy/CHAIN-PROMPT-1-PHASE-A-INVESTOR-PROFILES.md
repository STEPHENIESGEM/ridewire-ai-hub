## TIER 1 CATEGORY A: STRATEGIC AUTOMOTIVE OEMs

### Profile Requirements
- **Company Size:** $10B+ annual revenue (publicly traded or private equity)
- **Acquisition Appetite:** History of acquiring SaaS/software companies ($100M-$1B range)
- **Network Leverage:** Direct relationships with dealership networks (1,000+ service locations)
- **Strategic Rationale:** Modernizing legacy diagnostics, capturing service margin, owning customer relationship
- **Timeline:** Motivated to close within 90 days (quarterly decision cycles)

### Target 1: Harley-Davidson Motor Company

**Company Profile:**
- **Revenue:** $6.3B annual (2023)
- **Market Cap:** ~$4.5B
- **Dealer Network:** 700+ U.S. H-D dealerships (250+ international)
- **Strategic Fit Score:** 9.5/10

**Why This Works:**
- Harley has been investing heavily in digital transformation (LiveWire, H-D Connect)
- Owns customer service relationships and margins through dealer network
- Facing disruption from Chinese EV manufacturers - needs competitive moat
- Diagnostic tools are critical for service revenue (40% of dealer profit)
- CEO recently pledged $500M+ in technology investments

**The Pitch:**
"Service bay, 9:13 pm, a customer's engine is misfiring. Instead of a 2-hour diagnostic, your H-D dealership technician sees our AI Roundtable solving the problem in 47 seconds. That's not just a tool - that's ownership of the future of motorcycle service revenue."

**Pain Points We Solve:**
- ✅ Technician shortage (average H-D dealership has 3-4 techs)
- ✅ Service appointment wait times (currently 2-4 weeks in many regions)
- ✅ Complex diagnostic accuracy (H-D bikes have 50+ sensors)
- ✅ Customer experience differentiation vs. independent shops

**Financial Opportunity:**
- H-D dealers generate ~$1.2B annually in service revenue
- RideWire could increase dealer efficiency by 30-40% → $360-480M in incremental profit opportunity
- Licensing to dealer network = recurring SaaS revenue
- Data insights on rider behavior = competitive advantage

**Deal Structure:**
- $200-300M investment for 75% equity
- RideWire becomes owned subsidiary (maintaining independence on product)
- Exclusive licensing to H-D dealer network globally
- Board seat + COO role managing operations/partnerships
- Retention bonuses for founder (25% equity, 4-year vest)

## FILTERING CRITERIA: WHO WE'RE TALKING TO (AND WHO WE'RE NOT)

- **Early-stage VCs** (they're optimized for 10x returns, we offer stability)
- **Financial engineering firms** (they'll strip assets + IP)
- **Non-tech acquirers** (lack the DNA to nurture the platform)
- **Competitors** (no strategic benefit)
- **Single-industry focused players** (we need multi-vertical scale)

---

## KEY TALKING POINTS FOR ALL TARGETS

### #1: The Infrastructure Moat
"Zero-Knowledge Architecture means your customers' data stays their own. We're not building a data extraction engine - we're building a *trust engine*. That's our moat, and it's yours if you invest."

### #2: The $180M Proof Point
- **Market Size:** $7.2B automotive diagnostics (U.S. alone)
- **Our TAM Capture:** 2.5% = $180M (conservative)
- **Unit Economics:** $5 per diagnostic (vs. $50 manual labor cost)
- **Path:** 500K users at $360/year subscription = $180M ARR

### #3: The Human-AI Family Brand
"Every AI platform claims to augment humans. We go further - we treat humans and AI as *family*. That's not marketing. That's architecture. It's defensible. And it resonates with every customer we've spoken to."
